    // The Logic of Java is the same as C#,Python,VB
    // The Syntax, Environment, and Support Structure are all different

    // Two types of loops
    // For Loops, for doing things a certain number of times
    // While Loops, for repeating while something is true or false
    // Must decide upon and keep track of counters for the loop, both the start and the end
    // This is the convention for a FOR LOOP:

    // TODO For (COUNTER STARTING POINT ; CONDITION FOR RUNNING ; ITERATION/COUNTER BEHAVIOR) {CODE YOU WANT TO REPEAT}
    //  EXAMPLE:
    //        for (int x = 0 ; x < 10 ; x++) {
    //            System.out.println("x = " + x);
    // You can nest loops inside each other
